Makefile commands:
"make Go" - builds the console version of the game
"make gui" - makes a basic gtk window pop up

input a column and row number when prompted, if a group of pieces is completely surrouned orthogonally by enemies it will be deleted
objective of the game is to control the most territory(Have the most empty pieces surrounded only by pieces of your color).

Area Scoring: 1 point for each piece on the board, 1 point for each empty space controlled.

Territory Scoring: 1 point for each enemy piece captured, 1 point for each empty space controlled.

Currently the board and pieces interact correctly and Area Type scoring is working correctly, the input is easy to break and cause infinite loops.

Ancient Chinese Board Game Go
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_game

Requires gtkmm3.0 w/ cairo library to build.

currently a very basic gui interface, players alternate selecting where
to place pieces or to pass, both players must pass (a usual sign of an end of 
game) in order for the score to display. No board reset is available, and it
appears the gtk interface is causing memory leaks.


Scoring Types: Area Scoring is on by default, can be switched in source in myarea.cpp

Area Scoring: 1 point for each piece on the board, 1 point for each empty space controlled.

Territory Scoring: 1 point for each enemy piece captured, 1 point for each empty space controlled.
